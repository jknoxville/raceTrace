=========

A real-time group tracking app for android, created by John Knox, 2013

* Allows mutliple participants to track each other in real time on screen.
* Communication uses cellular data or WiFi.
* Java server application is included.*
* App can operate using the server or completely peer-to-peer.

*Server groups participants by location before starting, but this feature is buggy. It currently only works 
for one session at a time.
